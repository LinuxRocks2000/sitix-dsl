ultimate goal: be able to use,
- sitix build <directory>                              ; to get a bytecode of the sitix app
- sitix static <directory>                             ; to generate static files
- sitix dev <directory>                                ; to spin a development server
- stxvm run app.stxc                                   ; to run a sitix app in a production-ready server
- stxvm static app.stxc                                ; to generate static outputs from a sitix app

note: you can't use sitix to build a single file. this is because the VM loads every file in the project as a TrackedFile and does parsing + resolving,
before starting to actually process any files. this sounds naive, but actually makes it much simpler to handle things like file includes - because
there's a preresolved syntax tree with guaranteed unique variable ids, it's safe to simply interpret them in place.
this doesn't extend to single files because all the practical uses of Sitix are multifile, and I don't feel like adding shims just to support
an unlikely and useless operation mode.

need to,
- add dynamo features
  - dynamo essentially provides a bunch of ffi features, including routing magic
- add the bytecode generator
- build the vm!
