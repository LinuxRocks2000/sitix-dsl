This is the Backus-Naur form for the Sitix grammar. We use the form
described in Crafting Interpreters.

note: the "completeness" is because I don't want to butcher the tokenizer for
expression-testing. rest assured this is far from done

sitix_expression -> (sitix_block | TEXT)*

sitix_block -> "[" block "]" | ("-" "]" sitix_expression closing)

closing -> "[" "/" "]"

block -> (statement ";")* statement?

statement -> expression

expression -> equality

equality -> comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )*

comparison -> term ( (">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=") term) *

term -> factor ( ( "+" | "-" ) factor)*

factor -> unary ( ( "*" | "/" ) unary)*

unary -> ( "!" | "-" unary ) | primary

primary -> NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | nil |
	( "(" expression ")" ) | ( "{" block "}" )
